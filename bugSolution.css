One solution to avoid problems with `calc()` and mixed units is to use only one type of unit within `calc()`, converting other values as needed.  Another strategy, if working with percentages is crucial, involves setting a container size first to ensure reliable calculations. For instance, you can set the parent container to a fixed width or use viewport units (vw, vh) for a more flexible approach.

Here's an example using fixed width parent:

```css
.container {
  width: 500px; /* Fixed width container */
}

.element {
  width: calc(50% - 10px);
}
```

Here's an example using viewport units:

```css
.element {
  width: calc(50vw - 10px);
}
```
These approaches provide more predictable and consistent rendering across different browsers.
